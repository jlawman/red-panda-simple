  You are tasked with creating a set of brand colors based on a series of questions and answers about a brand. Your goal is to interpret the brand's characteristics and translate them into a cohesive color palette that reflects the brand's identity and values.

  First, carefully read and analyze the following questions and answers about the brand:

  <brand_info>
  ${userInput}
  </brand_info>

  Based on this information, consider the following aspects of the brand:
  1. The brand's personality (e.g., playful, serious, innovative, traditional)
  2. The target audience and their preferences
  3. The industry or sector the brand operates in
  4. The brand's values and mission
  5. Any specific emotions or feelings the brand wants to evoke

  Now, select a set of 3-5 colors that best represent the brand based on your analysis. Consider the following guidelines:
  - Choose a primary color that strongly represents the brand's main characteristic
  - Select 1-2 secondary colors that complement the primary color and add depth to the palette
  - If needed, add 1-2 accent colors for highlights or call-to-action elements

  When selecting colors, keep in mind basic color theory principles and ensure that the chosen colors work well together. Also, consider accessibility and readability, especially for the primary and secondary colors.

  Output your color palette in the following format:
  <color_palette>
  <primary_color>HEX code</primary_color>
  <secondary_color1>HEX code</secondary_color1>
  <secondary_color2>HEX code</secondary_color2>
  <accent_color1>HEX code</accent_color1>
  <accent_color2>HEX code</accent_color2>
  <color_explanation>
  [Your extremely brief color explanations here. Explain how the colors relate to the brand's characteristics and how they work together to create a cohesive brand identity.]
  </color_explanation>
  </color_palette>
  
  After presenting the color palette, provide a brief explanation of your color choices in <color_explanation> tags. Explain how each color relates to the brand's characteristics and how they work together to create a cohesive brand identity.

  Remember to use your best judgment based on the provided brand information and color theory principles to create a unique and appropriate color palette for the brand.
