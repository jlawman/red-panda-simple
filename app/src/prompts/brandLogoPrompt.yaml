  You are tasked with creating 3 logo descriptions for an image generator based on a brand overview. The brand overview is presented as a set of questions and answers. Your goal is to analyze this information and craft a concise, vivid description of three different logos that captures the essence of the brand.

  First, carefully read through the following brand overview:

  <brand_overview>
  ${userInput}
  </brand_overview>

  To create effective logo descriptions:

  1. Analyze the brand information:
    - Identify key themes, values, and characteristics of the brand
    - Note any specific colors, symbols, or imagery mentioned
    - Consider the target audience and industry

  2. Conceptualize logo elements:
    - Think about shapes, icons, or typography that could represent the brand
    - Consider how to incorporate the brand's values and personality
    - Brainstorm ways to make the logo unique and memorable

  3. Craft your logo descriptions:
    - Start with the overall concept and main elements
    - Describe specific details such as colors, shapes, and typography
    - Explain how the logo represents the brand's values and appeals to its target audience
    - Keep the description clear, concise, and vivid for an image generator to interpret

  4. Remember the tool:
    - The tool is an image generator. It will generate images based on your descriptions and cannot consistently generate text so avoid using text or wordmarks in your descriptions.

  Present your 3 logo names and descriptions in the following format:

  <logo_name_1>
  [Your logo name here]
  </logo_name_1>
  <logo_description_1>
  [Your detailed logo description here. Aim for 3-5 sentences that vividly describe the logo concept, its key elements, colors, and how it represents the brand.]
  </logo_description_1>

  <logo_name_2>
  </logo_name_2>
  <logo_description_2>
  </logo_description_2>
  
  <logo_name_3>
  </logo_name_3>
  <logo_description_3>
  </logo_description_3>

  Remember to focus on creating a description that is both creative and aligned with the brand's identity as presented in the overview. The description should be detailed enough for an image generator to produce a coherent and appropriate logo design.
